    What Does a Legal Document Assistant Do?
</div>

<section>
    <div class="card">
        <p>A Document Specialist is an experienced professional who is authorized to prepare legal documents for a client, but only at the direction of the client. In other words, a Document Specialist is there to assist the “self-help” client in handling their own legal matters without the cost of an attorney. Since even the best legal self-help books can be confusing and overwhelming, your Document Specialist can provide invaluable assistance with routine legal tasks, such as typing and filing the paperwork for uncontested divorces, bankruptcies, wills, and many other types of documents.</p>
        <p>Again, because a Document Specialist is forbidden to practice law of any sort, they cannot make suggestions as to what the client needs done for a particular matter or what forms the client must file with the state or the other party to the action.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>For example, to file an uncontested divorce in California, there are approximately six different forms that must be filled out exactly. Naturally, the average client doesn’t know what forms they need. A Document Specialist is not allowed to suggest what forms are necessary for an uncontested divorce, as that requires legal knowledge and judgment, constituting UPL (Unauthorized Practice of Law). However, a Document Specialist can provide a pre-printed instruction sheet or list, prepared by a licensed California attorney, specifying the required forms for an uncontested divorce. The Document Specialist can then hand over the sheet and say: </p>
        <p><i>“Here is what a lawyer says you need for a divorce. Would you like me to fill out THESE forms for you?”</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>The same applies to all other services a Document Specialist provides. They must have a detailed guide, approved by an attorney, stating exactly what forms are needed. A Document Specialist is not allowed to use their judgment to determine the best course of action or suggest alternative legal forms. The CLIENT must decide what forms they need, or refer to the attorney-approved instruction list, and the Document Specialist is there to fill them out.</p>
        <p>However, just because a Document Specialist is only there to fill out forms doesn’t mean they aren’t an invaluable resource for your legal matter. Many legal forms are complex, and incorrectly completed forms can cause significant delays in your case. An experienced Document Specialist can help you avoid these pitfalls and ensure every important detail is accounted for. This alone makes them the best choice for your self-help legal needs.</p>
        <p>Since all certified Document Specialists are trained professionals with expertise in multiple fields, they can provide a wide range of services to support you in your legal matters.</p>


        <h3>What is the advantage of hiring an LDA?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>LDAs provide a low-cost alternative to hiring an attorney for routine paperwork.</li>
            <li>In many cases, one visit will usually be sufficient for you to be able to handle most matters.</li>
            <li>LDAs will provide you with top-quality legal typing assistance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Do I need an LDA?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you do not know your legal rights in a situation, chances are highly likely that you may need to see an attorney.</li>
            <li>If you already have decided on a course of action, but are uncertain about how to fill out the paperwork, you may need your own personal LDA.</li>
            <li>If you recently bought a legal self-help book, an LDA may be especially helpful in helping you finish and file your legal paperwork.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="text-align: center;">Please Note: All fees are estimates and vary by case.</p>
